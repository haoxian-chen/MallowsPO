# MallowsPO
We include necessary components needed for implmenting ICLR 2025 paper [MallowsPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14953) in the trainer script, modified from [trl](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) DPO trainer. MallowsPO can be implemented pretty easily by modifying from the common LLM RLHF libaries' implementations on DPO. A more detailed codebase, which takes MallowsPO as a special instance (contextual scaling), can be found at [RainbowPO](https://github.com/CapitalOne-Research/RainbowPO).
