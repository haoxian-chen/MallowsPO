# MallowsPO
We include necessary components needed for implmenting MallowsPO in the trainer, modified from [trl](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) dpo trainer. MallowsPO can be implemented pretty easily by modifying from the common LLM RLHF libaries' implementations on DPO. A more detailed codebase, which takes MallowsPO as a special instance (contextual scaling), can be found at [RainbowPO](https://github.com/CapitalOne-Research/RainbowPO).
